Hi,
	use kernel encrypto/decrypto ALG is two ways: one is socket wiht "AF_ALG", one is "dev/cryptodev".
	if use "/dev/cryptodev", you need compile the encryptoAPI to kernel and it will support an interface to userspace program
	and there are two demos for "dev/cryptodev" and socket with "AF_ALG"

	ofcouse, you can learn openssl API,that can help you understand socket (AF_ALG)program

	cherrs !
